This project was developed as part of the selection process for DWS.

## Technologies/libraries used

- React 19 + Vite 7
- Redux

## Running steps

First of all you'll need to install the dependencies by running:
```js
npm i
```
After that you can run it locally with:
```js
npm run dev
```

I've added some simple tests just for example, for runing them just use:
```js
npm run test
```
